My tools build scripts

This Repository contains scripts for building tools used by me

* Layout
  All tools are installed within _HOME_ directory.
  because _HOME_ directory is usually mount through NFS on different
  machines, architecture and operating system, then there are couple
  assumptions where apps are installed.

  Machine dependent files are installed within:
#+BEGIN_SHELL
  ${HOME}/install/<MACHINE DIR>/
#+END_SHELL

  Machine independent files are installed within:
#+BEGIN_SHELL
  ${HOME}/install/share/
#+END_SHELL

  Some tools are installed in tool specific directories read more in [[#Tools][tools]]

  Some tools are installed from [[#Packages][packages]]
